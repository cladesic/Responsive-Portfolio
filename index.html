        My name is Charles Ladesic, I’ve been in support for over 27 years that include telecommunications to Information Technology. Early in my career I spent 9 years installing, programming, and
        project management in the telecommunication industry. The remaining 18 years was various positions at Verizon which included monitoring alarms in the Network Operation Center “NOC” to support and
        development in Application Support. During this time I obtained my Associate and Bachelor degree in Informational Technology of Arts. 
        Along the way I’ve gained several friends and professional mentors that have assisted me in my career goals.

        I’m currently continuing with my education to refresh and learn new programming languages/methods that will further my career in becoming a full time developer. 
        I enjoy working or solving issues that occur in applications and find ways to improve or correct the issue in both reactive and proactive. My current job role is working on 
        Zero-Touch automation, which is to take the human aspect out of repeating processes that can be automated. My career has provided me with some great knowledge through trial and error, along the way I found reading
        log files can save several hours or isolation.
